# Qualifiers
My team (CDDC Team6), comprising momentumn and myself (subraram), participated in the CDDC 2024 Qualifiers. It was a 30-hour Jeopardy-style CTF which took place from 27 May 10:00 - 28 May 16:00. There were challenges from seven topics. The challenges were significantly harder than the training challenges, as expected. However, they were pitched at various difficulty levels, so I was able to attempt some challenges with more confidence than others.

We were able to solve 8 out of 26 challenges, scoring 800 points. With a total of 700+ teams participating across different categories (University, ITE/Polytechnic and Junior College), our team roughly placed 130th in our category. The scoreboard closed one hour before the end of the CTF, so we don't have the final rankings.

## Topics
These were the topics covered, as well as the number of challenges that my team could solve in each topic.

|Topic|Solved|Total|
|-----|------|-----|
|1. System Binary Vulnerability|0|4|
|2. Reverse Engineering|2|5|
|3. Forensics|2|5|
|4. Web Application Vulnerability|1|4|
|5. Network Analysis|1|2|
|6. OSINT|0|3|
|[7. Cryptography](7%20Cryptography "Cryptography")|2|3|

## Thoughts
It was interesting that most of the challenges had the flag format wrapped after finding the answer string. This is a good move, as it avoids unintended solutions from just searching the flag format in the challenge files. It forces participants to use the right methods to solve the challenges, ensuring that they have the required knowledge to get the flag. As such, the challenges designed were of good quality and I would like to thank the CDDC team for organising the event.

Although we didn't make it to the finals, we have picked up problem-solving skills and the use of cybersecurity tools from the training platform. We were able to apply them to solve the qualifier challenges. This event is definitely a stepping stone and the knowledge gained here will be useful for future CTFs.

# Introduction to Networking
This topic is a part of Basic Concepts of Cybersecurity.

## Overview
(Computer) Networking refers to interconnected devices which exchange information in the form of data and share resources. These networked devices use a system of rules, known as protocols, to communicate. The data is passed through the layers of the OSI model when sent from the source to the destination. Each device has ports which run a variety of services, such as HTTPS, FTP and DNS.

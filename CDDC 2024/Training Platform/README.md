# Training Platform
CDDC had set up a training platform which was open from 29 April - 25 May. Participants were able to learn about cybersecurity concepts through lectures, assessments and challenges from 16 topics. I have learnt a lot from solving the challenges on the training platform. I was able to solve 100 out of 125 challenges. This was a lot more than I expected, since it had been a while since I participated in CTFs.

# Overview
Throughout the month, I watched the lectures for each topic. They gave the introduction to the respective topics, as well as references to read more on the topics. Although the lectures may not have the depth, they pointed me in the right direction to read more.

The assessments tested information from the lectures and highlight the main points of the lectures.

Generally, the first few challenges in each topic tested information from the lectures, online sources and some thinking. The rest of the challenges can be solved with the correct approach. Once I could get the approach, I was able to search for the tools required to solve the challenge. The challenges from the training platform taught me that I don't need to know any advanced programming techniques. I just need the right approach to tackle the challenges.
